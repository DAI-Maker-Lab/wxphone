# wxPhone
wxPhone is an open-source weather station design based on the Seeeduino Stalker V3, Adafruit FONA and BME280 breakout boards, and Ambient Data Systems weather meters. It is a work in progress and is presently being field tested in Silver Spring, Maryland in the United States and Malang, Indonesia.

The design will not work with the newer Stalker V3.1 boards; among other issues they do not supply enough current to power the FONA. This is a problem. The next iteration will use a different microcontroller and a configuration that allows the BME280 board to be mounted separately from the other electronics, so that only the BME280 is exposed to the air.
